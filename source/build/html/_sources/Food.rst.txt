====================
Japanese BBQ at Home
====================

Dadiel tried his darndest, but by the end of the night, meats of at all levels of doneness had been served, from still alive to charred black. However, there were enough success to warrant another attempt in the not too distant future, hopefully. Plus, Laura made some nice sauce. Great job Laura!

Hailed by Laura's father as possibly the best muffins he has tasted - soft on the inside with a crispy streusel.
